All DOC files here are in russian. Comments in all files are also in russian,
but several comments in myparser.h and myvar.h were translated to english.

Parser was created when I was a student, so the code is a bit ugly, but it has 
no bugs/memory leaks (checked with MemProof and BoundsChecker).
All files except Editor.*, ScrRun.*, Unit1.*, UnitFrm.* should compile fine 
under WatcomC, GCC and Borland C++ 5.x

scripting.txt contains some english docs.
